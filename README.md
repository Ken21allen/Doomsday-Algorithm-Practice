# Doomsday-Algorithm-Practice
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application created using AutoIt for practicing the Doomsday algorithm, which is used to calculate the day of the week for any given date. The application generates random dates, and the user is required to determine the correct day of the week

Features
Random Date Generation: The application generates a random date within a specified range (1800 to 2100) and displays it
Day of the Week Buttons: Users can select a button corresponding to a day of the week (Sunday to Saturday) to guess the correct day
Validation: The application checks if the selected day matches the calculated day of the week for the generated date
Feedback: The selected button turns green if the userâ€™s guess is correct, and red if it is incorrect
Date Check: Users can request the application to display the correct day of the week for the generated date
Random Date Regeneration: Users can generate a new random date by clicking a button

This code can be compiled and run using AutoIt to create an interactive tool for practicing the Doomsday algorithm.

Installation: 
Install AutoIt
Save the code in a .au3 file
